# Visual Computing Project for Developers

## Project Overview
Designed for developers interested in computer graphics, vision, and visual arts, this project focuses on image synthesis and analysis.

## Key Areas
1. **Visual Computing Principles**
   - Computational and mathematical methods for digital image creation, capture, analysis, and manipulation.
   - Includes: Image acquisition, basic image processing, image warping, and anti-aliasing.

2. **Digital Special Effects**
   - Applying visual computing principles to create movie and commercial special effects.

3. **Visual Programming**
   - Developing graphical interfaces using C/C++ and OpenGL, for photo synthesis and manipulation.

## Project Prerequisites
- Proficiency in differential calculus and linear algebra.

## Goal
The project aims to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications in digital art and visual effects, enhancing developers' skills in visual computing.
